- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
 5 hours total (4 TA hours, 1 Office Hour) and counting...

- What are your initial impressions of Java?
 I do not like it. It has way too specific syntax and too many functions for such simple things. It is very annoying.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
They share the same operators, and the.... Java has a way more specific syntax, as well as more functions which you need to know how to use to be successful (Scanner, ArrayList, printing etc.). I find that python is easier to look at due to the lack of curly brackets, however with Java the indentation of some things doesn't matter. Java also seems to be a complier whereas Python may be an interpreted language (I could be wrong though). In general, maybe because I am new to Java, I feel like you have to be a lot more aware when coding it, because the slightest of things, like punctuation or functions missing will mess up the code. Java does have a few cool functions like .equalsIgnoreCase.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked for me was mapping out my work on a piece of paper going step by step. Google was my best friend for finding functions to be used (Oracle, w3schools & Stack Overflow). Please try and use one type of array lists, I have not clue what I did and now my printing does not work. Do not let people claiming that they are 'done' with the assignment let you feel like your behind, all work will eventually work and we all have different ways of getting there. I still want to try the Kudos stuff, but try ask a Professor or TA for those, since my peers found it a bit hard too.
